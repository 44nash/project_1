# Inflation Rate Analysis

###### Authors: Rikin, Tyler, Juan, Marcus, Emmanuel

## Intro : In this project, we set out to visualize and analyze inflation in the United States, and attempt to understand which other types of economic metrics lead to, correlate with, and are a result of inflation. We looked at various different metrics such as; GDP, Unemployment Rate, Tax Rates, Money Supply, Bank Borrowing, Income Per Capita, and more.

### Step 0: Understanding Inflation

Before we jumped into coding, we took a deep dive into what Inflation is, and what types of factors may be related to inflation. Inflation is the rate at which the value of the USD falls, hence the amount of "stuff" one dollar can buy decreases. It is common to use the change in Consumer Price Index or Producer Price Index to mark inflation. 

### Step 1: Pulling Data

We used various different API's to pull in all these metrics. We quickly learned that the Federal Reserve Economic Data API would be a vital tool in this project. We were able to access data from FRED using QUANDL's python API.
